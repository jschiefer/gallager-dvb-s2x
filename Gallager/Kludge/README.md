This netstandard.dll files is supposed to be a workaround for [Issue 3309 ("tricky to use .NET Standard
2.0 from FSI")](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/3309), which in turn is fallout from the infamous ["Sorry, no FSI under .NET Core"](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/issues/2407) issue.

Not convinced it works, though. At least not on .NET 4.6.2.
